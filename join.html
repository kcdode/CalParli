		<p>The Parliamentary Debate at Berkeley team is a student run organization that has a long history of success that has made the program one of the best in the nation. In 2013 the team was able to have debaters Andrew and Ryan have a competitive season and rank nationally as the 21th best.
			In 2014, debaters Jake and Ryan were able to continue the organization’s success with their duo being ranked 22nd and the second team of debaters Andrew Chang and Ryan Hang being rank 4th in the nation.
			The next year in 2015 the team continued its success with the duo of Kevin Yanofsky and Jake Glendenning being ranked 7th and debaters Taha Ziaee and Alice Lin being ranked 10th in the nation.
			That year Berkeley was the only school in all of Parliamentary debate that had 2 teams being ranked within the top ten.
			In more recent history the club has had the best success in terms of competition with having 3 teams that qualified to compete in the National Parliamentary Debate Association (NPDA) and 4 teams at the National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence (NPTE), both are the national championships for the circuit.
			The greatest success comes from debaters Tom Kadie and Henry Tolchard wining both national tournaments.
			Besides having both national champions the Duo of Amanda Miskell and Isabella Riezler finished their season being ranked 3rd at NPTE and 5th at NPDA.

			The tournament is one of the nation’s top competitions for high school parliamentary debate. Besides this tournament, the team for several years has hosted the Golden Gate Invitational,
			which similar to NPDI is a highly competitive tournament that many across the national come to compete in college parliamentary debate.
