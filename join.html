			In 2014, debaters Jake and Ryan were able to continue the organization’s success with their duo being ranked 22nd and the second team of debaters Andrew Chang and Ryan Hang being rank 4th in the nation.
			The next year in 2015 the team continued its success with the duo of Kevin Yanofsky and Jake Glendenning being ranked 7th and debaters Taha Ziaee and Alice Lin being ranked 10th in the nation.
			That year Berkeley was the only school in all of Parliamentary debate that had 2 teams being ranked within the top ten.
			In more recent history the club has had the best success in terms of competition with having 3 teams that qualified to compete in the National Parliamentary Debate Association (NPDA) and 4 teams at the National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence (NPTE), both are the national championships for the circuit.
			The greatest success comes from debaters Tom Kadie and Henry Tolchard wining both national tournaments.
