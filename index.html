				<h2>PDB hosts Golden Gate Invitational, with the help of St. Mary's College! </h2>
				<p>Last weekend, Parliamentary Debate at Berkeley hosted the Golden Gate Invitational, despite power outages and nearby fires that tested the resilience of the team and greater debate community. After learning less than 36 hours before the tournament that UC Berkeley would be shutdown over the weekend, PDB leadership worked tirelessly to find a new and affordable venue on short notice. Fortunately, St. Mary’s College generously offered us the necessary space to relocate the entire tournament, and 28 teams from 12 different schools were able to compete. Even though nearby fires nearly forced an evacuation, and half of Sunday’s rounds took place in rooms without electricity, the tournament continued thanks to the resilience of everyone involved. <br> <br>

					Six out of the 16 teams that broke at the tournament were from PDB; BR and MY both reached semifinals (after going undefeated in prelims), while NS reached quarterfinals, and JS, KZ, and AM all made it to octas. PDB debater Ryan Rashid won top speaker, and six out of the top ten speakers were from Berkeley. <br> <br>

					A huge thank you to Matt Swanson and the rest of the St. Mary’s team for allowing us to host GGI on your campus, this tournament would not have been possible without you! And thank you to everyone for bearing with us amidst the power outages and fires that occurred over the course of the weekend!

				<h2>PDB wins the Steve Hunt Classic!</h2>
				<p>Parliamentary Debate at Berkeley travelled to Portland, Oregon on the October 10th weekend and won its 3rd tournament in 3 weeks at Lewis and Clark College’s Steve Hunt Classic! All 5 PDB teams finished in the top 12, with 2 ultimately advancing to elims. PDB BR (Bonet and Rashid) went 5-1 in prelims and won 1st place after dropping only a single ballot, and have officially qualified for the NPTE. At the time of this post, they are the first and only team in the nation to qualify! They also retook 1st in NPTE rankings, with over 22 points in just three tournaments of competition. PDB MR (Miskell and Yang) was 1st seed with a 5-1 record after prelims before dropping in quarterfinals on a 1-2 decision. Our 3 other teams (KZ, JS, and NS) all narrowly missed reaching eliminations; each finished 3-3, and were the three next teams in line to break. PDB also placed seven of the top 20 speakers at the tournament, with Brian Yang winning his first-ever top speaker recognition! Returner Amanda Miskell took 5th, and first-year debaters for the team Karthik Krishnan and Michael Jayasuriya brought home awards as 3rd and 9th speakers, respectively.

<!--				<h2>PDB wins the Keeling Invitational Fall at Chabot College!</h2>-->
<!--				<p>On October 4th, Parliamentary Debate at Berkeley traveled three teams of our new members to Chabot College’s Keeling Invitational Fall in Hayward, CA, just a stone’s throw away from Berkeley!  With the coaching and leadership help of 2019 NPDA co-champion and team alumna Jessica Jung, PDB NS (Nikoubin & Shadmany) finished prelims at 3-1, and went on to win finals on a 2-1 and take home the tournament championship! Meanwhile, AH (Alpert & Huang) went 2-2 and nearly broke to elims. PDB BK (Bhasin & Kazim) also finished 1-3 in prelims at their first ever NPDA tournament!-->

<!--				<h2>PDB closes out the Rice University Classic</h2>-->
<!--				<p>This past weekend, two Parliamentary Debate at Berkeley teams attended the Rice University Classic in Houston, Texas. Both teams advanced to finals after winning their semifinals rounds, closing out the tournament. Their success won PDB the 2nd Place School Sweepstakes, despite only sending 2 teams out of 24 total in the tournament. Shannon Bonet and Ryan Rashid (PDB BR) had a perfect tournament, going 6-0 in prelims and completing their elimination rounds without dropping a single ballot, making it to the finals after picking up against Rice University CS. Amanda Miskell and Brian Yang (PDB MY) went 5-1 in prelims and defeated University of the Pacific FL in semis to complete the tournament closeout. Brian, Shannon, and Amanda earned 3rd, 5th, and 6th Best Speaker respectively, while Ryan’s 11th Best Speaker ranking narrowly missed a top 10 spot. BR’s incredible run also places them as the current #1 team in NPTE rankings - a spot that they’ll be aiming to keep for the rest of the year!-->

<!--				<h2>PDB attends the Golden Gate Opener</h2>-->
<!--				<p>Parliamentary Debate at Berkeley attended our first tournament of the season this past weekend, where we sent 12 debaters in 6 teams to the Golden Gate Opener at San Francisco State University. Out of the 12, 11 were first-time debaters for PDB! Sophomore Ryan Rashid was the only returning PDB member for GGO, partnering with freshman Shannon Bonet. Our teams did incredibly well overall: 5 of the 6 advanced to elimination brackets, and 4 debaters earned top 10 speaker awards. MM and NS made it to octofinals, JS and BR both reached quarters, and KZ reached semis before dropping to the tournament champions, Lewis & Clark MT. Detailed results are available on our records page. We thank SFSU for hosting GGO, and look forward to an exciting debate season!-->
