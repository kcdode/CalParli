				<h2>PDB closes out the Rice University Classic</h2>
				<p>This past weekend, two Parliamentary Debate at Berkeley teams attended the Rice University Classic in Houston, Texas. Both teams advanced to finals after winning their semifinals rounds, closing out the tournament. Their success won PDB the 2nd Place School Sweepstakes, despite only sending 2 teams out of 24 total in the tournament. Shannon Bonet and Ryan Rashid (PDB BR) had a perfect tournament, going 6-0 in prelims and completing their elimination rounds without dropping a single ballot, making it to the finals after picking up against Rice University CS. Amanda Miskell and Brian Yang (PDB MY) went 5-1 in prelims and defeated University of the Pacific FL in semis to complete the tournament closeout. Brian, Shannon, and Amanda earned 3rd, 5th, and 6th Best Speaker respectively, while Ryan’s 11th Best Speaker ranking narrowly missed a top 10 spot. BR’s incredible run also places them as the current #1 team in NPTE rankings - a spot that they’ll be aiming to keep for the rest of the year!

				<h2>PDB attends the Golden Gate Opener</h2>
				<p>Parliamentary Debate at Berkeley attended our first tournament of the season this past weekend, where we sent 12 debaters in 6 teams to the Golden Gate Opener at San Francisco State University. Out of the 12, 11 were first-time debaters for PDB! Sophomore Ryan Rashid was the only returning PDB member for GGO, partnering with freshman Shannon Bonnet. Our teams did incredibly well overall: 5 of the 6 advanced to elimination brackets, and 4 debaters earned top 10 speaker awards. MM and NS made it to octofinals, JS and BR both reached quarters, and KZ reached semis before dropping to the tournament champions, Lewis & Clark MT. Detailed results are available on our records page. We thank SFSU for hosting GGO, and look forward to an exciting debate season!
